Understanding the importance in the gaming world will help in determining the sales that esports may bring in and its expected lifespan while also providing us with an insight into the League of Legends community and its positive impacts to society. Gaming has resulted in a new form of entertainment which has created positive personal experiences, improving many individuals’ well-being, and with the consistent growth of eSports, increases in life standards will continue to rise whilst bonding a community that shares a similar mindset."

Through a replicator dynamic model, we can analyse the growth rate of players with their intended strategy which may include watching videos to learn different theories or playing the game more to enhance their understanding of the game. Over time, we can determine the more effective strategy through each player’s in game ranking by sorting the agent types which are the strategies used, and the parameter, which will group how many use a particular strategy in our model. Replicator dynamic models capture the most prevalent strategies and have become an evolutionary dynamic for games both sociological and ecological. Replicator dynamic models can also be used to determine viewership that may migrate to lol esports, by looking at the popularity and quality of each esport league. Quality can be determined via the number of teams, frequency of games and regularity of that branch's esport games.\n",

    "Intro to Human Centered Complex Systems was overall a good subject. Although it was a little bit confusing at times, I gained a lot from it. It made me think about everything in different ways. Especially my games, since I play a lot of games. And because of this project, I now see markov chains in my dreams. And several systems in the world around me. For this project, I worked on  2, 3, 4 and 5(Markov Models). My group members also worked on the other things as well as parts of 2, 3 and 5. I also did all of 4 because I have experience in coding. I also moved all the work from google docs to Jupyter Lab for the pre submission. This was because I was the only one who got my git working.  And also because I knew how to use markdown. I wasn't able to move things into Jupyter Lab for the final submission because my computer broke. The positives I took from this project were the versatility of models and how they could be shaped to different situations. The main thing I learnt was the importance of having enough data. Because the data we found was incredibly lacking as discussed above. This was also the biggest challenge we faced, and sadly we could not tackle it. I tried to remedy the missing data with extrapolation, but it's patchwork at best. Trying to shape the data to fit the model is very difficult. Another challenge I encountered was my computer breaking. This meant that I didn't have my usual programming set up and could no longer use git. So for the programming and the assignment, I typed it up in google docs with my phone. And for the git, I got one of my teammates set up so they could also submit. If I was faced with a real life problem. I would look through my human centered complex systems notebook and use all the models that sound vaguely similar to my situation or have a similar concept or idea. Then I would try to use them all. Basically throw every single dart at the wall and see what sticks. If I throw enough, one of them will work. Furthermore wisdom of the crowd shows that several somewhat correct answers creates an overall accurate one."
