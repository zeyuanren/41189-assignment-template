    "From the above models, we can see that each have their own capability of analysing specific data that are ultimately beneficial to the eSports scene. However, through research it can be believed that the Markov chain may be the most useful in interpreting the bright future of the competitive eSports scene. The Markov chain can predict viewership growth which is done by creating states such as “not playing the game”, “playing the game” and “watching esports”. As we can see these states comprise this system and can change states according to transition probabilities and is likely to move from one state to another. When this is applied to the viewership in eSports, we can see there is a linear growth in both viewers and players becoming viewers each month throughout every year. However, due to the complexity of Markov models, just gauging the growth rate is not using this modelling process to its full potential. Since there is also an underlying mathematical process which can be used to calculate probabilities to effectively determine the outcome of growth in percentages. While the Markov model is probably the most effective solution, the SIR model can also be used to determine the player base turnover rate which can affect the viewership in competitive eSports. The SIR model is able to show a detailed view of the fluctuations in the player base which can be seen as the population being infected so they increase in viewership. This model allows for some great analysis however, when compared to the Markov model, it is not as specific towards targeting our proposed question.The replicator dynamics model is more detailed towards the concepts within the eSports community which can ultimately affect the player base. It determines the most rational choice which can help keep players intrigued so that there will be a consistency throughout the future. While it may take a different approach, I still do not believe that it is more responsible than the Markov model, yet it is really still really beneficial towards analysing the detailed data of the community within eSports."

    "Intro to Human Centered Complex Systems was overall a good subject. Although it was a little bit confusing at times, I gained a lot from it. It made me think about everything in different ways. Especially my games, since I play a lot of games. And because of this project, I now see markov chains in my dreams. And several systems in the world around me. For this project, I worked on  2, 3, 4 and 5(Markov Models). My group members also worked on the other things as well as parts of 2, 3 and 5. I also did all of 4 because I have experience in coding. I also moved all the work from google docs to Jupyter Lab for the pre submission. This was because I was the only one who got my git working.  And also because I knew how to use markdown. I wasn't able to move things into Jupyter Lab for the final submission because my computer broke. The positives I took from this project were the versatility of models and how they could be shaped to different situations. The main thing I learnt was the importance of having enough data. Because the data we found was incredibly lacking as discussed above. This was also the biggest challenge we faced, and sadly we could not tackle it. I tried to remedy the missing data with extrapolation, but it's patchwork at best. Trying to shape the data to fit the model is very difficult. Another challenge I encountered was my computer breaking. This meant that I didn't have my usual programming set up and could no longer use git. So for the programming and the assignment, I typed it up in google docs with my phone. And for the git, I got one of my teammates set up so they could also submit. If I was faced with a real life problem. I would look through my human centered complex systems notebook and use all the models that sound vaguely similar to my situation or have a similar concept or idea. Then I would try to use them all. Basically throw every single dart at the wall and see what sticks. If I throw enough, one of them will work. Furthermore wisdom of the crowd shows that several somewhat correct answers creates an overall accurate one."

    "Introduction to the Human Complex System was a very interesting subject. It expanded my insight of the world and prepared me to make rational decisions in the real world. It was also enjoyable with lovely team mates who were always there to help each other along. My contribution to this assignment includes 1,2,5. The workload was fairly evenly spread out; everyone each played their important role in completing this project through such as researching for each other's information and coding python into github. I learnt many things from this project such as trying to code and understanding how gaming can be analysed, predicted and made better. I learnt that many models I learnt in Introduction to Human Complex System can be used to analyse and expand my insight in the real world as the many models I have learnt are very flexible and easy to implement after all required research and information are obtained. However, there were challenges faced when working through this project such as understanding some vital python codes, knowing how to use github and jupyter notebook. These are all very new to me as I have not learnt them in my previous studies. I eventually overcame these issues through looking at videos posted on Uts canvas by my lovely tutor and my teammates explaining the basics of coding to me. If I was faced with a real-world problem I would first carefully and closely examine the issue through different points of views and chose the most appropriate and flexible model to use. I would use the random walk model as it states to first states to do more thinking on bigger decisions with a larger influence over smaller choices with little influence. Thus, allowing me not to waste time and make important decisions first."

    "Our Introduction to Human-Centred Complex Systems subject project was overall fairly enjoyable. I contributed to section 3, 5 and 6. Other members contributed fairly evenly and at times put in extra effort to help each other out. These include times where we would schedule a meeting outside of class time to discuss and work on the assignment and also explaining to each other in depth the concepts, when we struggled to find an answer. I believe that my contributions have definitely helped out the group a lot and I am happy that I could make these positive contributions. This subject definitely taught me how to analyse detailed information and apply many model thinking to real life situations. I had the opportunity to learn in depth the models we selected in our assignment portfolio namely; Markov, SIR, Replicator dynamics. While I have learnt a lot of theory in this subject, I have also learnt the ability to coordinate with my group. Although it is not perfect, having this experience to work together with a group will always be useful in the future especially when working a team-oriented job. Some challenges I faced in this subject was setting up the required programs such as Jupyterlab, Github and git. I’m grateful that my group was able to help me out and walk me through the process to install and teach me how to use these programs. I also struggled to keep a consistent reflective portfolio throughout the first few weeks of the semester, however, later on I was able to catch up and write a reflection during the week of class. I think this was due to me realising how important it was to stay focussed throughout the semester because if I had fallen behind any further, it would have been a real struggle to get back to where I should be. If a real-world problem occurs where I will have to apply my newly learnt modelling skills, I would first make sure that I understand the situation and am clear of what agents are involved and then make a rational decision. If I were to be stuck in a prisoner’s dilemma, I will definitely remember the time we watched these informative videos in class and remember the critical outcomes that may occur. I would think back to the notion of altruism and analyse with a behavioural model accordingly. However, as shown in the video, anything could happen and ultimately it will be up to me to make the final decision and even though it could go great or horribly wrong, I will understand that the choice I made reflects my own intrinsic nature."
