    "The growing importance of League of Legends is vital to the esports industry as its rising popularity is forecast to achieve greater numbers in the future as a competitive game that promotes socialisation and team coordination. Understanding the importance in the gaming world will help in determining the sales that esports may bring in and its expected lifespan while also providing us with an insight into the League of Legends community and its positive impacts to society. Gaming has resulted in a new form of entertainment which has created positive personal experiences, improving many individuals’ well-being, and with the consistent growth of eSports, increases in life standards will continue to rise whilst bonding a community that shares a similar mindset."

Similarly, [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/20/heres-why-esports-can-become-a-billion-dollar-industry-in-2019.html) has also stated E-sports may become a billionaire industry in 2019.

In conclusion, statistical modelling and regression analysis cannot account for events like the coronavirus pandemic. And the shift caused by the coronavirus will cause struggles predicting the viewership/revenue for future years as there will be a loss of one years data."
